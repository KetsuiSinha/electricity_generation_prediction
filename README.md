# ELECTRICITY GENERATION PREDICTION
The major challenge in electricity energy is its storage. There are technologies available which can store electricity but either they are expensive or are not efficient to store large amounts of energy effectively. Efficient energy storage can improve energy reliability and reduce waste. However, it is not possible to store electricity in massive quantities consistently in all cases, and continuous generation of electricity from renewable sources is not always feasible since it requires more precision, infrastructure, and expertise.

# CONTENTS OF DATASET
Max. Demand Met during the Day (MW) : The highest amount of electricity demand that was successfully supplied during the day, measured in megawatts.

Shortage during Maximum Demand (MW): The amount of electricity shortage experienced when demand was at its peak, measured in megawatts.

Energy Met (MU): The total amount of energy provided to meet demand, measured in million units (MU).

Date: The specific date on which the data was recorded.

Temperature: The ambient temperature during the data recording period, which can affect electricity consumption.

Humidity: The level of humidity during the data recording period, which can influence energy use patterns.

Wind Speed: The speed of the wind during the data recording period, which can impact energy generation, especially from wind sources.

Holiday Flag: An indicator specifying whether the data was recorded on a holiday, which can affect energy consumption patterns.

Real Estate Growth: The rate of growth in real estate development, which can influence electricity demand.

Difference: The variance between the electricity demand and the supply met, reflecting the gap or surplus in energy provision.
